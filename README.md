# Weird Text
WeirdText encodes and decodes words. Encoded message can be read quite simply by a human. But Machines may find it difficult to read this message (to decode it). 
## Encoding
For each original word in the original text, the first and last character stay in the same position, but all the characters in the middle of the word are shuffled (permutated).
## Decoding
From the encoded the words list are used to decode the text. Decoded output should, as far as possible, be identical to the original text.


Application created for recruitment purposes. It was written using Python 3.7 and is compatible with 3.6.
